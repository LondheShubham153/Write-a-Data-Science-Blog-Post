## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute: </br>
` pip install -r requirements.txt `

You will need to download Stackoverflow’s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

To move the downloaded files to the specific folder, you can execute. </br>

1. Stackoverflow’s 2017 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/survey_results_public2017.csv `</br>

2. Stackoverflow’s 2018 data </br>
` mv survey_results_public.csv Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post/survey_results_public2018.csv `</br>

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What are the most used programming languages in India? </br>
2. What are the most wanted programming languages in India? </br>
3. How does programming languages used at work relates with programming languages people want to learn? </br>

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

**programming_data_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis. </br>
**survey_results_public2017.csv**: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data. </br>
**survey_results_public2018.csv**: Stackoverflow's 2018 Annual Developer Survey data. </br>

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@trainwithshubham/what-does-indian-programmers-want-a45290a5295)
